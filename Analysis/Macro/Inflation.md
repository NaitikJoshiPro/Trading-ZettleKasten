Inflation is the silent thief of wealth and one of the biggest forces that shape markets.  
It’s the general increase in prices over time, meaning your money buys less.  
In trading and investing, understanding inflation is not optional — it's critical.

## Why Inflation Matters

- Inflation affects **interest rates**, **consumer spending**, **corporate earnings**, and **asset prices**.
- High inflation → central banks raise rates → borrowing costs rise → growth slows → markets pull back.
- Low inflation or deflation → central banks cut rates → borrowing becomes cheap → markets rally.

Macro depends heavily on inflation trends.

## Causes of Inflation

1. **Demand-Pull Inflation**
   - Too much money chasing too few goods.
   - Consumer demand > supply.

2. **Cost-Push Inflation**
   - Input costs rise (wages, materials, energy), and companies pass those costs to consumers.
   
3. **Built-In Inflation**
   - Wage-price spiral: workers demand higher wages because prices are rising, businesses hike prices to pay wages, cycle repeats.

## How Inflation is Measured

- **CPI (Consumer Price Index)**: Measures the average change over time in prices paid by consumers for goods and services.
- **PPI (Producer Price Index)**: Measures changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output.
- **Core Inflation**: Excludes volatile food and energy prices for a more stable view.

## Inflation’s Impact on Markets

- **Stocks**: Moderate inflation = good for equities (pricing power). High inflation = bad (margin compression).
- **Bonds**: Inflation erodes bond returns; higher inflation = higher yields, lower bond prices.
- **Currencies**: Currencies of countries with lower inflation often strengthen relative to high-inflation currencies (especially in [[Forex (Foreign Exchange)]]).
- **Commodities**: Inflation often leads to rallies in hard assets like Gold and oil.

## Inflation & Central Banks

Central banks like the Federal Reserve or ECB are inflation watchers.  
Their **primary tools** to fight inflation are:

- Raising interest rates (tightening).
- Selling assets off their balance sheets (quantitative tightening).

Central banks have **inflation targets**, usually around 2%.  
If inflation overshoots, markets start to price in aggressive rate hikes, which crushes risk assets.

## Inflation in Action

- **2021–2022 Inflation Surge**: After COVID-19 stimulus, inflation spiked globally.
  - Result: Fed hiked rates aggressively, stocks fell, [[Forex (Foreign Exchange)]] volatility exploded.
- **1970s Stagflation**: High inflation + low growth. Nightmare for both stocks and bonds.

## Trading Inflation

- **Rate Sensitivity**: Know that higher inflation expectations = higher rates = pressure on risk assets.
- **Sector Rotation**: In high inflation, defensive sectors (utilities, consumer staples) outperform.
- **Hedge with Commodities**: Assets like Gold tend to perform well during inflationary periods.
- **Watch Real Rates**: Nominal bond yields minus inflation expectations. Real rates dictate asset prices more than nominal rates.

## Final Note

Inflation is always moving — it’s either accelerating or decelerating.  
Your job as a trader is to know which way it's trending and how markets are *pricing* that movement, not just reacting after the fact.
