Interest rates are the cost of money.  
They affect every part of the economy — from mortgages to business loans to asset valuations.

In trading, you ignore rates at your own peril.  
Rates move markets. Full stop.

## Why Interest Rates Matter

- **Stocks**: Higher rates = lower valuations = stock prices fall. Lower rates = higher valuations = stock prices rise.
- **Bonds**: Rates and bond prices move inversely. Rates up → bond prices down.
- **Forex**: Higher rates strengthen a currency, lower rates weaken it.
- **Commodities**: Higher rates increase the cost of holding commodities, often leading to lower prices.

Macro is built on the backbone of where interest rates are and where they’re going.
## Who Controls Interest Rates?

- **Central Banks** (Federal Reserve, ECB, BOJ, etc.)
- They set **benchmark rates** (like the Federal Funds Rate) which impact short-term borrowing.
- Longer-term rates (10-year treasury yields etc.) are set by the market.

Policy rates directly impact liquidity in the system:
- Rate hikes = liquidity drain.
- Rate cuts = liquidity flood.

## Key Types of Interest Rates

- **Nominal Rate**: The stated rate, not adjusted for inflation.
- **Real Rate**: Nominal rate minus inflation.  
  Real rates drive investment decisions.
- **Effective Rate**: The real-world rate after compounding.
- **Overnight Rates**: Like SOFR or EONIA, used for very short-term lending between banks.

## Yield Curve

- **Normal Curve**: Long-term rates > short-term rates. Healthy economy.
- **Inverted Curve**: Short-term rates > long-term rates. Recession warning.
- Yield curve inversions often predict a recession 6-18 months out.

Traders watch the **2s/10s spread** (difference between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields) closely.

## Interest Rates and Risk Assets

- Lower rates = Cheaper borrowing → Business growth → Higher corporate earnings → Higher stock prices.
- Higher rates = Costlier borrowing → Slowdown in growth → Lower stock prices.

Valuations like DCF models are hypersensitive to interest rates. A 1% change can dramatically alter fair value estimates.

## Practical Trading Insights

- **Dovish Fed** (lowering rates or staying low) = bullish stocks, weak dollar, strong gold.
- **Hawkish Fed** (raising rates aggressively) = bearish stocks, strong dollar, pressure on gold and risk assets.
- Watch the **Fed Dot Plot** for future expectations.
- Keep an eye on **Fed Funds Futures** for market predictions of rate moves.

## Real World Examples

- **2020 COVID Crisis**: Rates cut to near zero → massive rally in risk assets.
- **2022 Inflation Fight**: Fed hikes rates at the fastest pace in decades → stocks, crypto, bonds all sell-off.

## Final Note

Interest rates are not just numbers — they’re a narrative.  
Every hike or cut signals fear, greed, growth, or panic.

If you trade macro assets and you don't understand interest rates, you are just another player at the table who doesn't know the rules.
