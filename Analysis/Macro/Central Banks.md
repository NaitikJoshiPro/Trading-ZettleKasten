# Central Banks

Central banks are the final boss of macro.  
They set interest rates, print money, kill rallies, or start them.  
Ignore them and you get smoked — especially if you trade [[Forex (Foreign Exchange)]], indices, or anything macro-sensitive.

## Why They Matter

- Control **monetary policy** — interest rates, inflation targeting, money supply.
- Influence everything from consumer spending to investor behavior.
- Decide when markets risk-on or risk-off.
- First-order impact on currencies, bonds, and indirectly everything else.

## Major Central Banks

- **Federal Reserve (Fed)** — 🇺🇸
- **European Central Bank (ECB)** — 🇪🇺
- **Bank of England (BoE)** — 🇬🇧
- **Bank of Japan (BoJ)** — 🇯🇵
- **People’s Bank of China (PBoC)** — 🇨🇳
- **Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)** — 🇦🇺
- **Swiss National Bank (SNB)** — 🇨🇭

Each has its own style, history, and tolerance for inflation.
## Tools They Use

### 1. **Interest Rates**
- Raise rates → borrowing costs more → slows economy → cools inflation.
- Cut rates → borrowing cheaper → stimulates spending → boosts risk assets.
### 2. **Quantitative Easing (QE) / Tightening (QT)**
- QE = Buying bonds to inject liquidity.
- QT = Selling bonds or letting them mature → drains liquidity.
### 3. **Forward Guidance**
- Just talking about rate hikes can move markets.
- “Soft jawboning” is a real tactic.
## Key Events to Watch

- **FOMC Meetings** (Fed)
- **Rate Decisions** (BoE, ECB, etc.)
- **Press Conferences** and statements
- **Dot plots**, **minutes**, and **inflation targets**

Check Macro calendar regularly — no excuse.  
You don't want to be long risk when Powell’s about to nuke the market.

## Trading Impact

- Rate decisions move markets fast — volatility spikes.
- Fed hikes → dollar up, equities down.
- Surprise dovishness → risk-on rallies.
- Long-term: Central banks define the *regime* you're trading in.
## Final Note

Don’t fight the Fed. Don’t front-run the ECB.  
Learn the cycle. Trade with the flow, not against it.
