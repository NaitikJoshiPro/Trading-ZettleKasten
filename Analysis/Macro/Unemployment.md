Unemployment is a direct measure of economic health.  
If people aren’t working, they aren’t spending. If they aren’t spending, businesses suffer, earnings fall, and stocks tank.

Simple.

## Why Traders Watch Unemployment

- **High unemployment** = Weak economy = Central banks more likely to cut rates = Risk assets can rally (in anticipation of stimulus).
- **Low unemployment** = Strong economy = Central banks more likely to hike rates = Risk assets face pressure (especially growth stocks).

It's not just about the number, it's about how it **trends**.

## Types of Unemployment Data

- **Unemployment Rate**: % of people actively looking for a job but can’t find one.
- **Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP)**: Measures the number of new jobs added (excludes farming sector). Released first Friday of every month. Huge event for [[Forex (Foreign Exchange)]] and [[Indices]].
- **Participation Rate**: % of working-age people actually working or looking for work. Declines here are a red flag.
- **Average Hourly Earnings**: If wages are growing fast, it might lead to inflation, pushing [[Central Banks]] to hike rates.

## How Unemployment Affects Markets

- **Worse than expected unemployment** → Markets initially dip → but stimulus bets → markets often recover fast.
- **Better than expected unemployment** → Could push bond yields higher → could pressure equities depending on the inflation narrative.

The reaction depends heavily on **context**:
- In a growth-driven market: Good data = Good.
- In an inflation-fighting market: Good data = Bad (because it means rates stay high).

## Practical Trading Insights

- **NFP Day**: 
  - Expect extreme volatility, especially in [[Forex (Foreign Exchange)]] (USD pairs) and indices like SPX and NASDAQ.
  - Avoid opening positions right before release unless you’re trading a specific news strategy.
- **Trend Watching**:
  - 3-6 months of worsening unemployment = Recession brewing.
  - 3-6 months of falling unemployment = Recovery brewing.

## Real World Example

- **2020 COVID Shock**: Unemployment spiked to 14.7% in the U.S. → Massive government and Fed intervention → Risk assets bottomed and rallied.
- **2022 Tight Labor Market**: Despite rate hikes, unemployment stayed low → Inflation stayed sticky → Fed kept hiking.

## Final Note

Markets don't move because of absolute numbers.  
They move because of **expectations versus reality**.

If everyone expects a disaster and the report is only mildly bad, the market rallies.  
If everyone expects great news and the report is just "okay," the market tanks.
