Geopolitical risk is the unseen hand that can swing markets for better or worse.  
A war, trade war, election, or natural disaster can flip the risk-on/risk-off switch.  
If you ignore geopolitics, you’re ignoring one of the biggest volatility drivers.

## Why It Matters

- Geopolitical events *move markets* unexpectedly.
- Can cause **commodity price shocks**, **currency fluctuations**, and **massive risk-off sell-offs**.
- Essential for global markets (especially [[Forex (Foreign Exchange)]] and [[Commodities]]).
- Directly impacts Macro outlooks and investor sentiment.
## Types of Geopolitical Risks

1. **Military Conflicts**
   - Wars, invasions, or threats of war (e.g., Ukraine-Russia conflict).
   - Military actions can disrupt trade routes, energy supplies, and raise uncertainty.
   
2. **Trade Wars / Tariffs**
   - Tensions between large economies (like the U.S. and China) affect global supply chains.
   - Tariffs or sanctions change the economics of entire industries (e.g., steel, tech).

3. **Political Instability**
   - Regime changes, revolutions, or coups.
   - Elections or referendums (e.g., Brexit) can disrupt markets for months.
   
4. **Natural Disasters**
   - Earthquakes, pandemics, and hurricanes can massively disrupt local and global economies.
   - Supply chain bottlenecks, especially in crucial industries (e.g., oil, semiconductors).

5. **Sanctions & Diplomatic Tensions**
   - Economic sanctions between countries, especially on major economies.
   - Diplomatic breakdowns (e.g., North Korea, Iran nuclear issue).
## Impact on Markets

- **Commodities**: War zones or geopolitical tensions near key supply regions can push oil and gas prices through the roof (e.g., Middle East tensions).
- **Currencies**: Safe-haven currencies (like the USD and JPY) tend to appreciate during geopolitical unrest.
- **Stocks**: Investors flee to defensive sectors (utilities, healthcare) or risk-off assets (gold) during political instability.
- **Bonds**: Bonds become a safe-haven in times of risk-off, especially US Treasuries.

## Geopolitical Risk in Action

- **Trade War Example**: The 2018 U.S.-China trade war saw massive volatility in [[Forex (Foreign Exchange)]] markets and hit tech stocks hard due to tariff uncertainties.
- **Military Conflict Example**: The Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022 caused oil prices to spike, impacting [[Commodities]] and sending shockwaves through the Macro landscape.

## How to Trade Geopolitical Events

1. **Follow the News** — Never be caught unaware. 
   - Subscribe to geopolitical newsletters, watch major media outlets, and be aware of upcoming summits or treaties.
2. **Understand the Risk Appetite** — Market sentiment shifts fast when tensions rise.
   - Short-term volatility is key, but long-term effects need adjusting to market expectations (i.e., inflation expectations).
1. **Trade Safe Havens** — If a crisis looks imminent, look to safe havens like Gold or defensive sectors.
2. **Hedging** — In uncertain geopolitical times, consider hedging your [[Forex (Foreign Exchange)]] positions or broader portfolio with options or other risk mitigation strategies.

## Final Note

Geopolitical risk is unpredictable but can be anticipated with sharp market awareness and continuous monitoring.  
Stay ahead of the curve and adjust your positions in real-time. Be and Opportunist, when bad shit goes down your first instinct should be to short the sector that was fucked and long defense.
