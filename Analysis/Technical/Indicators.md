Indicators are mathematical calculations based on price, volume, or open interest.  
They are used to **simplify complex market data** into something visual, easy to understand, and (hopefully) useful.

**Important**: Indicators are tools, not holy grails.  
They **lag** behind price, and if you blindly follow them, you’ll get wrecked.  
Price action always wins. Indicators just help confirm or deny your ideas.

## Types of Indicators

- **Trend Indicators**: Help you identify direction.
  - Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)
  - ADX (Average Directional Index)
- **Momentum Indicators**: Measure the speed/strength of price moves.
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - Stochastics
- **Volatility Indicators**: Measure how "fast" or "wild" price is moving.
  - ATR (Average True Range)
  - Bollinger Bands
- **Volume Indicators**: Analyze volume behavior.
  - OBV (On-Balance Volume)
  - Volume Profile [[Volume Profile]]
  - VWAP [[VWAP]]

## How to Use Indicators Properly

- **Confluence**: Use multiple indicators together with price action.  
  If structure, volume, and RSI all agree, then you have a better setup.
- **Context**:  
  Indicators behave differently in trending markets vs ranging markets.
  - RSI overbought in a strong uptrend? Price can stay overbought for a LONG time.
  - MACD crossing over in a chop fest? Garbage signal.
- **Simplicity**:  
  Less is more. 1-2 indicators max on your screen.  
  If you have 5 different things screaming at you, you’ll hesitate and lose.

## Most Commonly Abused Indicators

- **RSI 70/30**: People think anything above 70 is an automatic short and below 30 is an automatic buy.  
  Wrong. In strong trends, RSI can stay extreme for weeks.
- **MACD Crossovers**: Late signals. Confirm, don’t predict.
- **Bollinger Band Breakouts**: Breakouts mean volatility expansion, but don't mean direction. Can break and reverse hard.

## Real World Insights

- Big traders rarely rely on indicators alone.  
  Indicators are **training wheels** for newer traders, helping them see what experience will later teach them directly from price action.
- Some of the best traders I know use nothing but raw [[Price Action]] and maybe a Moving Average to help visually define bias.

## Final Note

An indicator can hint.  
An indicator can confirm.  
But an indicator will never replace experience, screen time, and actual understanding of market behavior.

You are better off learning **market structure** first, indicators second.
