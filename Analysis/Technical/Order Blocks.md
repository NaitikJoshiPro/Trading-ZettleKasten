Order blocks are zones where big players — banks, hedge funds, institutions — placed **large orders**.  
Price reacts to these zones because that’s where the real money is.

They’re not magic.  
They’re footprints.

## What is an Order Block?

An **Order Block (OB)** is the **last bullish or bearish candle before a strong move** (usually BOS).  
That candle shows where smart money entered the market — and if price comes back to it, they might defend that level.

- **Bullish OB** → Last bearish candle before a big bullish move.
- **Bearish OB** → Last bullish candle before a big bearish move.

You don’t just mark every green/red candle.  
You look for **displacement**, **imbalance**, and **structure shift** around that area.

## Identifying Good Order Blocks

1. **Structure Break (BOS)** right after the OB.
2. Candle is clean and **engulfed**.
3. Volume spike or imbalance nearby.
4. Retest hasn’t happened yet (unmitigated).
5. OB is in line with higher timeframe bias.

## Mitigation

When price returns to an OB → It’s called **mitigation**.  
Institution might still have unfilled orders there → So price reacts.

The cleaner and untouched the zone, the stronger the reaction might be.

## Using Order Blocks

- Use OBs as **entry zones** or **target zones**.
- Refine with **lower timeframes** for sniper entries.
- Always trade them **with context** — don’t just draw boxes randomly.

If you trade against the higher timeframe trend, you’re asking to get wrecked.

## Tips

- Pair with Break of Structure, Imbalance, Liquidity Zones.
- OBs closer to **session opens** (London/NY) hold more weight.
- Not every OB works. That’s why you use confluence and risk management.
## Final Thoughts

Order Blocks are **not a strategy**, they’re a tool.  
Use them to understand where money entered the market.

React, don’t predict.  
Watch how price behaves when it hits the block. (Basically just wait for confirmation)

Smart money leaves clues.  
Order Blocks are one of them.
