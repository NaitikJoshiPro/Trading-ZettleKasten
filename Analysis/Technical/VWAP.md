VWAP is the **average price** of an asset weighted by **volume** over a specific time period.  
It shows the **price at which most of the volume** has transacted during the session.

## Core Concepts

- **VWAP Line**: Represents the **average price** for the day. Traders use it to gauge whether the price is relatively high or low.
  - Above VWAP: Bullish sentiment.
  - Below VWAP: Bearish sentiment.

- **Anchored VWAP**: Applied to any specific starting point (e.g., from a swing high or low).
  - Useful for tracking the average price from specific events or time periods.

- **Volume Weighting**: More volume at a certain price point influences the VWAP more than a low volume transaction.
  - This gives it a better idea of where the **true market consensus** is.

## What it Tells You

- VWAP is a **dynamic support/resistance** level.
  - Price **respects** VWAP during consolidation phases.
  - **Breakouts** above or below VWAP often signal the next directional move.

- It helps identify **trend strength**:
  - Price above VWAP = uptrend (stronger if volume supports it).
  - Price below VWAP = downtrend.
## How to Use It

- **Trend Confirmation**: Wait for price to **break and hold** above/below VWAP to confirm trends.
- **Intraday**: Often used by day traders to **enter/exit trades** during the session.
- **Pullbacks**: Buy near VWAP in an uptrend or sell near VWAP in a downtrend.

## Pro Tip

Use VWAP with **order flow** and **price action** for **stronger conviction**.  
Combine with [[Indicators]] like moving averages or RSI for confluence.
