Support and Resistance are the most basic yet **most traded concepts** in technical analysis.  
They’re areas where price reacts — either **bounces** or **breaks**.

## What is Support?

Support is a **price level where demand is expected** to come in strong enough to stop the fall.  
It’s a **floor** — buyers step in, price holds.

- Happens where price previously bounced.
- Often used for **entries** in a bullish move.
- The more times price touches it without breaking, the weaker it gets.

## What is Resistance?

Resistance is the **opposite**.  
It’s where supply kicks in — sellers overpower buyers.

- It's a **ceiling** — price struggles to break above.
- Used to **take profits** or **enter shorts**.
- Repeated tests make it fragile over time.

## Dynamic vs Static Levels

- **Static** → Horizontal levels. Fixed prices (e.g. 1.0800 on EUR/USD).
- **Dynamic** → Moving averages, trendlines — change with price.

Both can act as support or resistance depending on where price is in relation to them.

## Key Principles

- **Flip Zones** → Support becomes resistance and vice versa after breakouts.
- **Liquidity Build-up** → Multiple taps = liquidity collection = fakeouts possible.
- **Zone, Not Line** → Think of these as areas, not precise levels.
- **Volume Clusters** often confirm strong S/R zones.

## Support & Resistance ≠ Entry Triggers

They’re **context tools**, not strategies.  
Don’t buy just because price hits support.  
Use in confluence with [[Price Action]], structure, volume, etc.

## Final Thoughts

The market respects memory.  
Price often reacts to old levels.

But nothing is guaranteed.  
Support can fail. Resistance can break.

These are not magic lines.  
They’re footprints of past intent — not promises for the future. but goddamn they work.
