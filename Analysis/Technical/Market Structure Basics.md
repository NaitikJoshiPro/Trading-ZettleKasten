Market structure is the **skeleton** of any chart.  
Before you even think about indicators, fancy entries, or strategies — you need to understand how price moves naturally.

If you don't understand market structure, you're gambling.

## Basic Concepts

- **Higher Highs (HH)**: Price makes a new high above the last high → Uptrend.
- **Higher Lows (HL)**: Pullbacks make higher lows → Uptrend continuation.
- **Lower Lows (LL)**: Price makes a new low below the last low → Downtrend.
- **Lower Highs (LH)**: Pullbacks make lower highs → Downtrend continuation.
- **Break of Structure (BOS)**: When price breaks a previous high or low, signaling a possible shift in trend.

## Phases of Market Structure

- **Accumulation**:  
  Price moves sideways after a long downtrend. Smart money builds positions quietly.
- **Markup**:  
  Price starts trending upwards. Higher highs, higher lows. The trend becomes obvious.
- **Distribution**:  
  Price stalls after an uptrend. Big players sell into retail buying.
- **Markdown**:  
  Price starts trending downwards. Lower highs, lower lows.

→ Smart money operates differently inside each phase.

## Example

1. Price makes Higher High → Higher Low → Higher High → BOS down → Lower High → Lower Low.  
   That's a full **trend reversal** sequence.

2. No new HH after HL? Warning sign.  
   No new LL after LH? Warning sign.

3. Sideways chop with no clear HH/HL or LL/LH? Stay patient.  
   No need to donate your money.

## Key Market Structure Patterns

- **Double Top/Bottom**:  
  - Potential reversal signals if confirmed with BOS.
- **Head and Shoulders / Inverse H&S**:  
  - Classic reversal patterns built into structure.
- **Ranges**:  
  - Price trapped between support and resistance levels. Breakout = trend potential.

## Things That Wreck Beginners

- **Fake Breakouts**:  
  Price fakes out above/below a level to grab liquidity before reversing.
- **Overtrading Chop**:  
  Trading inside a range without confirmation leads to death by a thousand cuts.
- **Ignoring Timeframes**:  
  Structure on the 1m looks like trash, but the 1h/4h shows a beautiful trend.  
  Always align your trade to a higher timeframe bias.

## Final Thoughts

Market structure is not magic. It’s **logic**.  
It’s just watching how buyers and sellers are fighting and who's winning.
