Volume Profile shows **where** volume traded — not just how much, but **at what price**.  
It's a vertical histogram plotted alongside the chart.

Instead of time-based volume, it gives **price-based volume**. ALMOST all trading world champions USE THIS AS AN INDICATOR.

## Core Concepts

- **High Volume Nodes (HVN)** → Areas where lots of transactions happened.
  - Usually zones of **acceptance**.
  - Price often ranges here.

- **Low Volume Nodes (LVN)** → Gaps between HVNs.
  - Price moves **quickly** through these.
  - Usually **imbalance** zones.

- **Point of Control (POC)** → Price level with the **highest traded volume**.
  - Acts like a magnet.
  - Strong S/R level.

- **Value Area (VA)** → Range where **70% of total volume** occurred.
  - Value Area High (VAH)
  - Value Area Low (VAL)

## What it Tells You

- Whether price is in **balance** (acceptance) or **imbalance** (rejection).
- Where **institutions** may have entered or exited.
- Where **liquidity** sits.
- Where future reactions might occur.

## How to Use It

- Trade **reversions** to the POC in ranging conditions.
- Look for **breakouts** out of VAH/VAL in trending conditions.
- Use LVNs for **targets** and **quick moves**.
- Combine with structure — don’t trade it blind.

## Pro Tip

Volume Profile is **context**, not entry signal.  
Pairs best with [[Order Blocks]], [[Price Action]], and [[Market Structure Basics]].

## Tools

- Visible Range (VRVP) → Adapts to chart view.
- Fixed Range → Apply to specific price/time window.
- Session Volume → One profile per day/session.
