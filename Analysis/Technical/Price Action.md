Price Action is **trading based purely on what price is doing** — no indicators, no lagging signals.  
Just raw market movement.

It’s the most **direct** and **unfiltered** view of what buyers and sellers are doing.

## What is Price Action?

Reading price action means:

- Watching **candlesticks**, **wicks**, **body closes**.
- Recognizing **patterns** like **breakouts**, **pullbacks**, **reversals**.
- Understanding **momentum** and **liquidity grabs**.
- Seeing when the market is **balanced** or **imbalanced**.

Price action is basically a story.  
A story of fear, greed, hesitation, aggression.

## Core Concepts in Price Action

- **Market Structure** → Higher Highs (HH) / Higher Lows (HL) or Lower Highs (LH) / Lower Lows (LL).
- **Support & Resistance** → Levels where price reacts multiple times.
- **Order Blocks** → Where big players entered.
- **Imbalances / Fair Value Gaps** → Areas price moves away from without much trading.

## Tools of Price Action Traders

- **Candlestick Patterns** → (Engulfing, Pin Bars, Inside Bars, etc.)
- **Swing Points** → Clear turning points on charts.
- **Trendlines** → Connect swing highs/lows to visualize trend.
- **Zones** → Mark areas, not lines (price reacts to zones, not thin lines).
- **Liquidity Pools** → Areas where stop losses are clustered.

## Why Use Price Action?

- **Less lag** than indicators.
- **More flexibility** across all asset classes.
- **Cleaner decision making**.

At the end of the day, all indicators are built **on past price** anyway.  
If you learn to read price itself, you don’t need to wait for a lagging confirmation.
## Cautions

- Price Action is **context-dependent**.
- It doesn’t tell you what will happen, it shows you what is happening.
- You still need **risk management** and a **defined setup** to be consistently profitable.

"Price speaks first. Indicators follow."

## Final Thoughts

Price Action is about understanding the flow of the market.  
It teaches you to react, not predict.  
It forces you to **respect uncertainty**.

Price ACTION IS KING.  
Everything else is noise.
