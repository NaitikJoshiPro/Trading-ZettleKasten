Sector rotation is the flow of money from one sector of the market to another.  
Smart money moves ahead of macro shifts — your job is to spot it, not chase it.

## Why does it happen?

Markets move in cycles. Ray Dalio has a great video on it https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0?si=aXdLjHuwW_1h2uv-

Different sectors perform better in different phases of the economic cycle — expansion, peak, contraction, recovery.

Example: (These are subjective and can change)
- During early recovery: Tech, Consumer Discretionary
- Mid-cycle: Industrials, Materials
- Late cycle: Energy, Utilities
- Recession: Healthcare, Consumer Staples

Investors rotate capital to sectors with the best risk/reward *for the phase we're entering*, not the one we’re in.

## Leading vs Lagging

- **Leading sectors**: Where money goes *before* a move
- **Lagging sectors**: Where money exits *after* a move

Rotation starts with leading sectors showing relative strength before indices confirm.

Check **sector ETFs** (like $XLK, $XLF, $XLE) — compare performance vs SPY.  
If $XLK is outperforming SPY while SPY is chopping, tech is leading.

## How to spot it?

- Use **relative strength** → Compare a sector ETF’s chart vs SPY.
- Monitor **volume + price divergence** → money flow signals.
- Watch **macro headlines** → interest rate changes, policy, inflation triggers rotation.

## How to use it?

- Align your trades with the sectors that are heating up.
- Avoid sectors with outflows unless you’re shorting.
- Use it for swing trades or positioning in ETFs or sector leaders.

Works best with Macro, Fundamentals, and broader market bias.

## Final thoughts

You don’t chase — you position.  
Rotation is a proxy for where institutions are reallocating capital.
