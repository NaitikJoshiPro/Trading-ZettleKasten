Insiders are people with access to non-public info about a company — CEOs, CFOs, board members, major stakeholders. Basically, people on the inside.

They buy or sell based on what *they* know is coming. And while they’re legally required to disclose trades (Form 4 in the U.S.), the alpha lies in understanding the intent behind the move.

## Why should you care?

Insiders don’t buy stock for fun. They either:
- Know something positive is cooking
- Want to signal confidence
- Or it’s just PR (buying 100 shares for optics)

Large, **clustered buying** from multiple insiders = strong signal.  
Consistent **selling** isn’t always bearish — could be compensation or tax-related. Context matters.
## Types of Insider Moves:

- **Buy**: Bullish if significant, especially after a dip.
- **Sell**: Not always bearish unless it's sudden and big.
- **Option Exercises**: Insiders exercising options can mean they're expecting upside, or just cashing in.
- **Volume Spike**: Sometimes you will see volume spikes in either the options or the stock itself, thats your signal. but HFT's Front Run that wayy before any retailer can step in. Also not all Spikes are Insider spikes. 
## How to track it?

- **OpenInsider**
- **Finviz (Insider tab)**
- **Form 4 filings on SEC.gov** (instead of trading even if you just became an investor and used this as your signal, you will be generating 100% every 1-2 years.)
- **WhaleWisdom** (tracks big funds too)

Look for:
- Multiple insiders buying
- Timing relative to earnings or big news
- Size compared to their total holdings
## How to use it?

Insider buying doesn’t mean "buy now." It means “watch this.”  
Combine it with your analysis — Fundamentals, [[Earnings & Reports]], or even Technical Analysis.

It’s not an entry signal. It’s a heatmap.
## Final thoughts:

Follow the money, but don't worship it.  
Insiders have more info — but that doesn't mean their timing is perfect. If you see Multiple Insiders piling up their own stock then go for it.
