Earnings season is where all the real movement happens in stocks. Every publicly traded company is required to report its financial performance quarterly — that means 4 times a year.

You want volatility? This is where it is.

These reports include:
- Revenue
- Net income
- Earnings per share (EPS)
- Forward guidance
- And sometimes just corporate cope

## Why do earnings matter?

Institutions trade based on expectations. If a company beats expectations, price often shoots up. If it misses, it can crash. But here’s the catch — **it’s not just about numbers**, it’s about *sentiment* around the numbers.

If a company reports good numbers but gives weak guidance, stock still tanks.  
If the numbers are mid but guidance is optimistic, stock pumps.


## Key Terms:
- **EPS (Earnings Per Share)**: Net income ÷ outstanding shares. Most-watched metric.
- **Guidance**: Company’s forecast for future revenue/earnings. More important than current numbers sometimes.
- **YoY / QoQ**: Year-over-year / Quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Used to spot growth or decline.
- **Surprise**: Difference between reported and expected EPS. Huge factor in post-earnings price action.

## How to trade earnings?

- Some people **swing into earnings** hoping for a pump. That's a coin toss.
- Smart money waits for the reaction and trades the volatility after.
- Even smarter ones avoid it unless there’s a solid edge or hedge in place.

Watch for:
- **IV crush** in options (→ [[Options Greeks]])
- Volume spikes
- Whiplash moves (price fakes out both directions, its great for straddles or fully hedged positions if you can manage)

## When is earnings season?

Usually starts 1–2 weeks after each quarter ends:
- Q1 earnings → April
- Q2 → July
- Q3 → October
- Q4 → January

Big names like Apple, Microsoft, Tesla usually go first or somewhere early — they set the tone for the market.

## Where to track earnings?

- **TradingView Calendar**
- **Yahoo Finance**
- **MarketWatch**
- **Seeking Alpha**
- **Earnings Whispers (for dates + sentiment)**

Set alerts for big names. If a major index stock is reporting, it can affect the whole market sentiment.

## Final thoughts:

Earnings = opportunity but also risk. Every Opportunity is a risk in one form or another.
Avoid gambling unless you're hedged or sized small.
Let volatility settle, find a level, then plan your trade.

If you're holding a position into earnings — that’s not a trade, thats a bet. Unless you have satellites monitoring the parking lots of Walmart to determine wether they will perform above expectation (yes some hedge funds have used that technique to make money).
