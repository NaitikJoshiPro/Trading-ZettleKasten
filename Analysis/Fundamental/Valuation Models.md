Valuation models help you estimate what a company *should* be worth.  
It’s how you figure out if something is underpriced, overpriced, or just hype.

## Why care?

If you're trading [[Equities]], understanding valuation tells you if you're betting on value or air.  
Institutions buy when the price is lower than value. Retail buys when price is higher than hype.

## Core Models

### 1. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**
- Projects future cash flows and discounts them back to present value.
- Assumes the company will survive and grow.
- Used mostly for mature, cash-generating companies.
- **Flawed if assumptions are garbage** — garbage in, garbage out.

### 2. **Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio**
- Price / Earnings per share.
- High P/E = Expensive or high growth expectation.
- Low P/E = Cheap or declining expectations.
- Compare P/E with historical sector averages.

### 3. **PEG Ratio**
- P/E divided by earnings growth rate.
- Accounts for growth. PEG < 1 usually considered undervalued.

### 4. **Price to Book (P/B)**
- Price / Book value.
- Good for asset-heavy sectors — banks, manufacturing.

### 5. **EV/EBITDA**
- Enterprise Value / EBITDA.
- Useful for comparing companies with different capital structures.
- Cleans up the noise from leverage and taxes.

## Relative vs Absolute

- **Absolute models**: DCF — values company on its own merits.
- **Relative models**: P/E, EV/EBITDA — values a company vs peers or sector.

Use both.  
Absolute tells you what something's worth.  
Relative tells you what people *might* be willing to pay.
## Warnings

- Markets don’t care about value short term.
- You can be right about value and still lose money if timing sucks.
- Valuation is better for swing, macro, or long-term plays — not scalping.

## Wrap

Valuation models ≠ prediction. They’re frameworks.  
Use them to avoid being exit liquidity for someone smarter.
