**Fair Value Gap (FVG)** and **Inverse Fair Value Gap (IFVG)** are concepts used to find **imbalances** in the market where price moved aggressively without filling orders.

These gaps often act like magnets — price tends to return to fill them before continuing.

# 1. **Fair Value Gap (FVG)**

FVG happens when there is an **imbalance** caused by an aggressive move. It creates a gap between candles, usually noticeable between the wicks.

### How to spot:

- In a bullish FVG:
    - Candle 1: Bullish
    - Candle 2: Bullish
    - Candle 3: Retraces slightly but leaves a gap between low of Candle 2 and high of Candle 1.

- In a bearish FVG:
    - Candle 1: Bearish
    - Candle 2: Bearish
    - Candle 3: Retraces slightly but leaves a gap between high of Candle 2 and low of Candle 1.

**Price often returns to this area before continuing.**

# 2. **Inverse Fair Value Gap (IFVG)**

IFVG is basically the **opposite**. It's where price aggressively retraces into a previously inefficient move — think of it like a **liquidity reclaim**.

- In IFVG, instead of price coming to fill the gap and continuing original direction, **price fills the gap and then reverses**.

- It usually happens when the original push was a fakeout or manipulation.

# 3. **Usage**

- **Entry**: You can enter trades when price taps into FVG or IFVG zones.
- **Stop Loss**: Set SL slightly beyond the FVG zone.
- **Take Profit**: Target return to previous highs/lows or next supply/demand zone.

**Important**: Use FVG and IFVG with confirmation from [[Price Action]] and [[Market Structure Basics]] — **never trade FVGs blindly**.

# 4. **Examples**

- In a strong uptrend, price creates FVG, pulls back into it, then continues up → Long.
- In a downtrend, price creates FVG, comes back, rejects, and falls → Short.
- In IFVG scenarios, price fakes a push up, fills the gap, and then dumps → Short on confirmation.

---

# 5. **Visual Cues**

- Big body candles with little or no wicks → possible FVG.
- Sudden sharp moves → likely FVG creation.
