## 1. The Illusion of Profits
Most people start trading because they see others getting rich from it. They want to get rich fast. But trading is a **zero-sum game** â€” for every winner, there's a loser.  
ðŸ“‰ **90-90-90 Rule**: 90% of traders lose 90% of their money in the first 90 days.

## 2. What Do You Trade?
You can trade: 
- [[Equities]]
- [[Forex (Foreign Exchange)]]
- [[Commodities]]
- [[Indices]]

If you trade:
- **Stocks** â†’ Understand [[Earnings & Reports]], use screeners.
- **Forex** â†’ Learn [[Interest Rates]], [[Inflation]], [[Geopolitical Risk]], [[Central Banks]].
- **Crypto** â†’ (Subjective) Driven mostly by sentiment. Proceed with caution.

## 3. Leverage & Lot Sizes
Understand:
- [[Leverage vs Effective Leverage]]
- [[Lot Sizes]]
- [[Margin]]
- [[Risk Management]]

Example: XAU/USD dipped 13% in a day once. Know that before using leverage. Don't let leverage become a death sentence. so a 1:8 Effective leverage will be good considering you have extra liquidity on the side incase of a margin call.

## 4. Strategy
You need one. No strategy = you *are* the liquidity.  
Popular ideas:
- [[Support & Resistance]]
- [[Order Blocks]]
- [[Inner Circle Trader (ICT)]]

- [[FIB Retracement]]
- [[Price Action]]

Alpha decays. You need to adapt.
