Position sizing is how much you risk per trade, based on your capital and risk tolerance.  
It is critical for survival and consistency in trading.

## 1. **Basic Formula for Position Size**

$$
\text{Position Size} = \frac{\text{Account Risk} \times \text{Account Size}}{\text{Stop Loss in Pips} \times \text{Pip Value}}
$$

Where:

- **Account Risk** = % risked per trade (e.g., 1% = 0.01)
- **Account Size** = Your total capital
- **Stop Loss in Pips** = Distance to your stop loss
- **Pip Value** = Value of each pip based on lot size

---

## 2. **Simplified Version (Forex Example)**

If you know pip value per lot and stop loss in pips:

$$
\text{Lots} = \frac{\text{Risk Amount}}{\text{Pip Distance} \times \text{Pip Value per Lot}}
$$

---

## 3. **Example**

- Account Size = $10,000
- Risk = 1% → $100
- Stop Loss = 20 pips
- Pip Value (standard lot) = $10

Then:

$$
\text{Position Size} = \frac{100}{20 \times 10} = 0.5 \, \text{lots}
$$

You would trade **0.5 lots**.

## 4. **Why Position Sizing Matters**

- Prevents large drawdowns.
- Keeps you emotionally neutral.
- Allows consistency even during losing streaks.

## 5. **Other Approaches**

- **Fixed Fractional Method**: Risk fixed % of account per trade (most common).
- **Kelly Criterion**: Risk based on edge and odds (advanced, aggressive).
- **Volatility-Based Sizing**: Adjust size based on volatility (higher volatility → smaller size).
