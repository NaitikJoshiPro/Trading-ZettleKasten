Trading is 90% mental and 10% execution.  
The market doesn't beat you — **you beat yourself**.

# 1. **Core Psychological Battles**

- **Fear**: Afraid to enter, afraid to lose.
- **Greed**: Overtrading, revenge trading, going heavy size.
- **Impatience**: Forcing trades, not waiting for setups.
- **Ego**: Needing to "be right" instead of being profitable.
- **FOMO**: Chasing moves you missed.

---

# 2. **Common Psychological Traps**

- **Moving Stop Loss** farther thinking "it'll come back."
- **Taking Profits Early** because scared to lose unrealized gains.
- **Doubling Down** on losers.
- **Overtrading** after a win ("house money effect").
- **Revenge Trading** after a loss.

---

# 3. **Mindset Required for Survival**

- **You will lose trades** → Accept it early.
- **Losses are tuition** → The market charges everyone.
- **Detach emotionally** from individual trades.
- **Judge your actions, not your outcomes**.
  - Good decision + bad outcome = still a good decision.

---

# 4. **How to Build Psychological Toughness**

- **Journal every trade** — especially emotional ones.
- **Define Risk Before Entry** — no guessing mid-trade.
- **Have Set Rules** — remove decision fatigue.
- **Accept Small Losses** — think like a casino, not a gambler.
- **Visualize Losing Days** — not just winning ones.

# 5. **After Winning Streaks**

- **Lower your size slightly.**
- **Reset expectations.**
- **Respect the market.**

(Overconfidence kills more traders than fear.)

---

# 6. **After Losing Streaks**

- **Cut size by half** until confidence rebuilds.
- **Focus only on A+ setups.**
- **Take a break if needed.**

(Trading tired, tilted, or desperate leads to death spiral.)

# 7. **The Market Owes You Nothing**

- You can do everything right and still lose.
- You can do everything wrong and sometimes win.
- **Long-term execution consistency** wins the game.
