Mental models are frameworks for thinking clearly and making better decisions under uncertainty and pressure. In trading, they help you react rationally instead of emotionally.

## 1. **Why Mental Models Matter in Trading**

- Trading is less about "calling tops and bottoms" and more about thinking probabilistically and surviving over the long run.
- Emotions like fear, greed, FOMO kill traders faster than bad strategies.
- Mental models force your brain to operate systematically.

## 2. **Important Mental Models for Traders**

### **Risk vs Reward**

Every decision is about **expected value**:

$$
\text{Expected Value (EV)} = (\text{Probability of Win} \times \text{Reward}) - (\text{Probability of Loss} \times \text{Risk})
$$

Only take trades where EV is positive.

### **Second-Order Thinking**

Don't just think about the immediate effect, think about the effect of that effect.

> "If the FED cuts rates, stocks might rally... but if inflation persists, the rally might be fake."

Always think: *And then what?*

---

### **Inversion**

Instead of thinking “how do I succeed?”, think:

> “How do I avoid failing?”

In trading: Avoid blowing up your account first. Profit comes second.

---

### **Survivorship Bias**

You only hear from the winners. Most traders who blew up aren't telling their story. Don't think trading is easier than it actually is.

---

### **Loss Aversion**

Humans hate losses more than they love gains. You MUST be willing to take small losses consistently. That's what keeps you alive.

---

### **Confirmation Bias**

You will automatically search for information that confirms your current bias. Always actively look for reasons you might be wrong.

---

### **Probability and Luck**

Short term outcomes are random. Even good trades can lose money. Focus on process, not outcomes.

---

### **Margin of Safety**

Have enough capital buffer so that unexpected moves don't wipe you out. Risk small.

---

## 3. **Summary**

- Mental Models > Emotions.
- Trading is probabilistic, not deterministic.
- Process > Outcome.
- Protect downside, upside will take care of itself.
