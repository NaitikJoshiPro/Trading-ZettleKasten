Drawdown refers to the peak-to-trough decline during a specific period of an investment, trading account, or portfolio's history. It is a key metric for evaluating risk, particularly in trading and investment strategies. Drawdown measures the percentage loss from the highest point (peak) to the lowest point (trough) before a new peak is reached. A smaller drawdown indicates better risk management.

## 1. **Formula for Maximum Drawdown (MDD)**

Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is the greatest loss observed from a peak to a trough, before a new peak is attained.

$$[
\text{MDD} = \frac{\text{Peak Value} - \text{Trough Value}}{\text{Peak Value}} \times 100
]$$

- **Peak Value**: The highest account balance before the decline.
- **Trough Value**: The lowest account balance after the peak, before a new peak is achieved.

## 2. **Formula for Drawdown (General)**

For any given period, drawdown can be calculated as:

$$[
\text{Drawdown} = \frac{\text{Current Balance} - \text{Previous Peak}}{\text{Previous Peak}} \times 100
]$$

- **Current Balance**: The current account balance.
- **Previous Peak**: The highest balance before the current drawdown.

## 3. **Formula for Recovery Time**

The recovery time is the period it takes for an account to recover from a drawdown and reach a new peak.

$$[
\text{Recovery Time} = \text{Time to New Peak} - \text{Time of Trough}
]$$

## 4. **Types of Drawdown**

### 4.1 **Maximum Drawdown (MDD)**
- This is the most significant loss during a specific time period and represents the worst-case scenario for an investor or trader.

### 4.2 **Relative Drawdown**
- It is the drawdown as a percentage of the highest account balance observed to date.

### 4.3 **Peak-to-Trough Drawdown**
- Refers to the loss incurred from the highest point to the lowest point (trough) of a trading account or portfolio during a specific period.

## 5. **Example Calculation**

Consider the following example:

- **Peak Value**: $10,000
- **Trough Value**: $7,500

Using the MDD formula:

$$[
\text{MDD} = \frac{10,000 - 7,500}{10,000} \times 100 = 25\%
]$$

Thus, the maximum drawdown is 25%.

## 6. **Impact of Drawdown on Trading**

Drawdowns represent the risks of large losses. A significant drawdown can have a substantial impact on a trader's psychology and trading behavior. It is important to keep drawdowns within acceptable limits to maintain long-term profitability and reduce the risk of emotional decision-making.

## 7. **Managing Drawdown**

- **Risk Management**: Keep drawdowns manageable by using appropriate stop-loss orders, position sizing, and diversification.
- **Position Sizing**: Adjust position sizes based on risk tolerance to avoid deep drawdowns.
- **Leverage**: Minimize the use of leverage to reduce the risk of large drawdowns.
- **Avoid Emotional Decisions**: Stick to your strategy, even during drawdowns, to avoid making impulsive trades.
