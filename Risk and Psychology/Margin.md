Margin is the collateral you need to deposit with your broker to open and maintain a leveraged position. It allows you to control larger positions with a smaller amount of actual capital.

Margin is NOT a cost, it’s simply a part of your account balance set aside by the broker while the trade is open.

## 1. **What is Margin?**

- Think of margin as a **good faith deposit**.
- It is required so you don't just walk in and control huge positions without any skin in the game.
- Margin requirement is usually shown as a **percentage**. (Example: 1%, 2%, 5%, etc.)

## 2. **How to Calculate Margin Needed**

General formula:

$$
\text{Required Margin} = \frac{\text{Lot Size} \times \text{Contract Size} \times \text{Price}}{\text{Leverage}}
$$

Where:
- **Lot Size** = how many lots you are trading
- **Contract Size** = standard unit size (usually 100,000 for forex)
- **Price** = current market price
- **Leverage** = your account leverage (e.g., 1:100)

---

## 3. **Example**

- Lot Size = 1 Standard Lot (1.0)
- Contract Size = 100,000
- Price = 1.2000
- Leverage = 1:100

Then:

$$
\text{Required Margin} = \frac{1 \times 100,000 \times 1.2000}{100} = 1,200
$$

You would need **$1,200** in margin to open 1 lot at 1.2000 price with 1:100 leverage.

## 4. **Types of Margin**

- **Initial Margin**: Amount needed to open a trade.
- **Maintenance Margin**: Minimum amount you must keep in your account to keep positions open.
- **Variation Margin**: Additional margin due to changing market conditions (margin calls happen when this gets too low).

---

## 5. **Margin Call**

When your account equity drops below the maintenance margin level, your broker will issue a **margin call**.

- Either you deposit more money
- Or the broker forcibly closes your positions to protect themselves

You NEVER want to get to this point. Proper risk management should keep you way above margin call levels.

---

## 6. **Free Margin and Margin Level**

- **Free Margin** = Account Equity – Used Margin
- **Margin Level** =

$$
\text{Margin Level (\%)} = \frac{\text{Equity}}{\text{Used Margin}} \times 100
$$

Margin level below 100% is extremely dangerous.

## 7. **Tips**

- Always monitor your margin usage, especially during high volatility.
- Keep your effective leverage low (1:5 to 1:10) if you want to survive long term.
- Margin is a tool — misuse it and you get wiped, use it smartly and you survive to trade another day.
