Risk management is **the most important** part of trading.  
No matter how good your strategy is, **bad risk management will blow you up**.

You don’t survive this game because you win, you survive because you manage risk.

# 1. **Fundamentals**

- **Never risk more than 0.5% - 1% per trade.**
- **Always use a Stop Loss (SL).**
- **Risk-Reward (RR) must make sense** — minimum 1:2 or better.

> No SL = no trading. Period. (or hedge if your position is too big)

---

# 2. **General Risk Formula**

$$
\text{Risk per Trade} = \text{Account Size} \times \text{Risk \%}
$$

$$
\text{Position Size} = \frac{\text{Risk Amount}}{\text{Stop Loss (Pips or Points)} \times \text{Pip or Point Value}}
$$

# 3. **Risk Management by Asset Class**


##  **Stocks**

- **Volatility**: Stocks move slower compared to Forex/Commodities. Daily moves are 0.5%-3% normally.
- **SL**: 1-2% below support for longs, above resistance for shorts.
- **RR Example**:
  - Entry: $100
  - SL: $98
  - TP: $104
  - Risk: $2
  - Reward: $4
  - RR: 1:2
- **Extra Tip**: Respect Earnings season — gap risk is real.

---

##  **Forex**

- **Volatility**: Major pairs like EUR/USD are stable. Exotic pairs are wild.
- **SL**: 20-50 pips on majors, 50-100 on minors/exotics.
- **RR Example**:
  - Entry: 1.1000
  - SL: 1.0975 (-25 pips)
  - TP: 1.1050 (+50 pips)
  - Risk: 25 pips
  - Reward: 50 pips
  - RR: 1:2
- **Extra Tip**: During news events (FOMC, CPI), either stay out or halve your normal risk.

---

##  **Commodities (Gold, Oil)**

- **Volatility**: XAU/USD can spike 10-15 dollars in minutes.
- **SL**: 10-20 dollars below/above key levels.
- **RR Example**:
  - Entry: $2000
  - SL: $1985
  - TP: $2030
  - Risk: $15
  - Reward: $30
  - RR: 1:2
- **Extra Tip**: Use lower leverage for commodities. They already move crazy.

---

## **Indices (SPX500, NASDAQ100, DAX)**

- **Volatility**: Indices whip like crazy on news or open/close hours.
- **SL**: 20-50 points depending on instrument.
- **RR Example**:
  - Entry: 5000 SPX
  - SL: 4975 (-25 pts)
  - TP: 5050 (+50 pts)
  - Risk: 25 pts
  - Reward: 50 pts
  - RR: 1:2
- **Extra Tip**: Reduce size during CPI, FOMC, NFP, Fed speeches. Indices get nuked easily.

---

## **Options**

- **Volatility**: Even a calm market can murder your option with time decay (theta).
- **SL**: Can’t set hard SLs sometimes — manage by premium lost (e.g., lose 50% of premium max).
- **RR Example**:
  - Buy Call for $2.00
  - SL: $1.00
  - TP: $5.00
  - Risk: $1.00
  - Reward: $3.00
  - RR: 1:3
- **Extra Tip**: Always use spreads or buy more time (longer expiry) to reduce theta burn.

---

##  **Futures**

- **Volatility**: Futures are leveraged beasts.
- **SL**: Must be *tight and fast*. Futures move 1 tick and can cost you 50-100 dollars easily.
- **RR Example**:
  - Entry: ES Futures 5000
  - SL: 4998 (-2 pts)
  - TP: 5006 (+6 pts)
  - Risk: 2 pts
  - Reward: 6 pts
  - RR: 1:3
- **Extra Tip**: Always trade with hard stop. Mental stops get murdered in Futures.

---

# 4. **Setting Stop Losses**

- Based on **Structure**: Just outside previous high/low.
- Based on **ATR (Average True Range)**: 1x to 1.5x ATR is normal.
- Based on **Fixed Pip/Point Amount**: Only if you know asset volatility.

**NEVER**:

- Put SL "where you feel like."
- Place random $100 SL because "you feel like losing $100 today."

---

# 5. **Risk Reward Mastery**

Minimum acceptable RR:

| Risk:Reward | Minimum Win Rate to be Profitable |
|:-----------|:----------------------------------|
| 1:1         | > 50% |
| 1:2         | > 33% |
| 1:3         | > 25% |
| 1:5         | > 17% |

# 6. **Examples of Good and Bad Risk**

**GOOD:**

- $100 risk for $200 reward (RR 1:2).
- 3 wins, 7 losses still = net profit.

**BAD:**

- $300 risk for $100 reward.
- 7 wins, 3 losses = still net loss.

---

# 7. **Psychology of Risk**

- **Small Risks = Small Emotions**.
- **Big Risks = Big Emotions** → leads to errors.

By keeping your risks tiny, you **stay objective**.

---

# 8. **Advanced Risk Tips**

- **Scale Out**: Close partials at TP1, trail SL to breakeven for rest.
- **Dynamic SL**: Tighten stop loss as trade moves in favor.
- **Correlated Trades**: Don't overexpose yourself to highly correlated trades. (e.g., 3 trades on tech stocks = triple tech risk.)

---

# 9. **Risking Across Strategies**

- **High Win Rate Strategy**: You can risk slightly higher per trade.
- **Low Win Rate / High RR Strategy**: Keep risks lower, let big winners come.

---

# 10. **Remember This**

You don’t go broke because you lose trades.  
You go broke because you lose **big** on a few trades.

Risk Small. Risk Smart.
