In trading, understanding **points** and **pips** is essential for measuring price movements accurately.

---

## 1. **What is a Point?**

- A **point** typically refers to a one-unit move in the price of an asset.
- Example:  
  If a stock moves from $150 to $151, that’s a 1 point move.
- In **indices** like S&P 500, "1 point" move = 1 index value move.

---

## 2. **What is a Pip?**

- **Pip** = "Percentage in Point."
- In Forex, 1 pip usually equals **0.0001** movement in currency pairs.
  - Exception: For JPY pairs (like USD/JPY), 1 pip = 0.01.

Example:

- EUR/USD moves from 1.1000 to 1.1001 → **1 pip**.
- USD/JPY moves from 150.00 to 150.01 → **1 pip**.

## 3. **Pip Value Formula**

To calculate pip value:

$$
\text{Pip Value} = \frac{\text{Pip Size}}{\text{Exchange Rate}} \times \text{Lot Size}
$$

Where:

- Pip Size = 0.0001 for most pairs, 0.01 for JPY pairs.
- Lot Size = Number of units traded.

---

### Example:

- Trading 1 standard lot (100,000 units) EUR/USD at 1.1000:

$$
\text{Pip Value} = \frac{0.0001}{1.1000} \times 100,000 = 9.09 \, \text{USD per pip}
$$

---

## 4. **Mini and Micro Pips**

- **Mini Lot** = 10,000 units → Pip Value is 1/10th of standard.
- **Micro Lot** = 1,000 units → Pip Value is 1/100th of standard.

## 5. **Points vs Pips**

| Asset   | Measurement | Example                            |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Stocks  | Points      | Move from $100 to $101 = 1 point   |
| Forex   | Pips        | Move from 1.1000 to 1.1001 = 1 pip |
| Indices | Points      | Dow Jones moves 100 points         |
