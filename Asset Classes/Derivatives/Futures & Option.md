Both Futures and Options are **derivative products**.  
They derive their value from the underlying asset like stocks, commodities, forex, or indices.

## Futures

- **Obligation** to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specific date.
- **Leverage** is baked into futures contracts. Small price moves = big changes in P&L.
- Futures are **linear** — the profit or loss moves 1:1 with the asset price.
- Used mostly for **hedging** or **speculation**.

Example:  
Buy gold futures at $2000 → If gold moves to $2010, you gain. If gold drops to $1990, you lose.

**Note**: Futures involve **rollovers** and **margin requirements**.

## Options

- **Right**, but not the **obligation**, to buy (Call) or sell (Put) an asset at a certain price before a set date.
- Options have **premium costs** (you pay to buy a contract).
- **Non-linear** movement — your option might lose value even if the asset moves in your favor because of **IV crush** or **time decay**.

**Key Terms**:
- **ITM (In The Money)**: Option has intrinsic value.
- **OTM (Out of The Money)**: Option has no intrinsic value yet.
- **IV Crush**: Volatility drops after an event → Option value tanks.
- **Theta Decay**: Time decay eats into option value every day.

## Common Misunderstandings

- Futures and Options **do not** move **perfectly** with the underlying asset.
- Many new traders think 5% move in stock = 5% profit in derivative.  
  No — it depends on premium, IV, delta, and other Greeks.
- **Options** are often safer because you can risk the premium only.  
  **Futures** can wipe your account out fast if you're not careful.

## Practical Advice

- Futures better suited for **hedgers** or **high-risk scalpers**.
- Options better for **controlled risk**, **directional bets**, or **event-driven trades** (like earnings, FOMC).
- If trading Options during volatile times → learn about **straddles**, **strangles**, and **hedging strategies**.
- I only use it for hedging against a BIG trade incase market is expected to be volatile.

## Reminder

These instruments are designed originally for **hedging**, not Trading (gambling).  
If you don't know what you're doing, you are the liquidity. You can Still trade 0DTE if only you know what you are doing.
