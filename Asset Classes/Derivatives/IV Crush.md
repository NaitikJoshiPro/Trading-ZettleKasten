**IV Crush** stands for **Implied Volatility Crush**.  
It’s when the implied volatility of an option drops suddenly, causing the option’s price to collapse, **even if the asset price barely moves**.

## When Does IV Crush Happen?

- Right after **big events** like:
  - Earnings Reports
  - FOMC Meetings
  - Major News Announcements
- IV builds up before the event → Everyone expects a big move.
- Event happens → No crazy move → IV drops hard → Option premiums crash.

## Example

You buy a call option before an earnings report expecting a big move.  
Earnings come out, stock barely moves.  
→ IV drops from 70% to 30%.  
→ Your option loses 30-60% value instantly **even if you were right** about direction.

## Why It Matters

- IV crush can destroy both calls and puts.
- If you hold naked options through events, you're betting against IV Crush without realizing it.
- Profits or losses depend not just on **direction** but also on **volatility expectations**.

## How to Deal With IV Crush

- **Sell options** before the event if you expect IV to drop.
- **Buy spreads** instead of naked options (e.g., vertical spreads) → limits IV exposure.
- **Avoid holding into events** unless part of a clear strategy like straddles.

## Core Principle

**Options are a bet on movement AND volatility, not just direction.**
