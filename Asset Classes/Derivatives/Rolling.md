Rolling means closing your current options position and opening a new one with a different strike or expiration.

You're not holding and praying. You're managing the position.

## Why Roll Options?

- **Avoid Expiration**: Don't let Theta and IV crush eat you alive.
- **Manage Risk**: Adjust strike closer/farther based on market conditions.
- **Extend Time**: Stay in a trade if the thesis is still valid.
- **Lock Profits**: If you're ITM (in-the-money), roll to secure profits without closing the trade.

## How to Roll

1. **Close** your current option (buy/sell).
2. **Open** a new option:
   - Further expiry date
   - Same or new strike depending on goal

Example:  
- You own a $100 Call expiring this Friday.
- It's Wednesday and your option is 20% profitable, but the move is slow.
- Roll to next month’s expiry at $105 strike to lock gains and stay in.

## ITM vs OTM Rolls

- **ITM Rolling**:  
  - Goal = Protect intrinsic value.
  - Roll out and **up** (higher strike).
  - Example: Your $95 call (stock is at $110) → Roll to $105 call next month.

- **OTM Rolling**:  
  - Goal = Extend time for your thesis to work.
  - Roll out, maybe lower strikes if needed.
  - Example: Your $120 call (stock at $105) → Roll to $115 call two months out.

## When Should You Roll?

- **25%-50% to Expiry**: Roll before Theta decay gets brutal.
- **Approaching Earnings/Event**: Roll to manage IV crush.
- **Directional Move Against You**: Roll to cut delta exposure.

## How Much Premium to Lose Per Roll?

- **Max 30%** of original premium per roll. (Personally anything more than 5-8% is too much because in a 3-6-12 month time frame almost no assets give enough consistent returns for you to cover your options premium cost but again Small moves in the underlying asset typically cause minor changes in long-dated OTM options. So a 1% move might barely dent your premium if your strike is reasonably placed and time is abundant.)
- If your roll costs more, your trade is already broken — don't throw good money after bad.
- Smart rolling is adding time, not stacking losses.

## How Far Should You Roll?

- **1-3 months** out depending on market condition.
- If the market is flat, longer.
- If volatility is high, maybe just a few weeks.

## Pro-Tips

- **Always Roll Early**: Never wait until expiration week. (Or even expiration month if the option is dated that far out.)
- **Roll for Credit if Possible**: Or minimum debit.
- **Stay Inside Liquid Strikes**: Wide spreads will kill you during roll executions.
