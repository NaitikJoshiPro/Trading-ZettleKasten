Hedging means reducing your exposure to risk.  
In trading, it’s the act of taking an **offsetting position** to protect your primary trade.
## Why Hedge?

- To **limit losses** during unexpected moves.
- To **lock in profits**.
- To **sleep better** without worrying about every tick.

Hedging is not about **making more money**.  
It’s about **losing less**.

## Hedging in Futures & Options

- If you have a **long position** in a stock or commodity, you can buy **Put Options** to protect yourself if price falls.
- If you have a **short position**, you can buy **Call Options** to hedge against an upside move.
- In Futures, you can take an **opposite futures position** to neutralize risk.  
  (Careful: futures hedging can get expensive due to margin requirements.)

**Example**:  
You’re long 100 shares of AAPL.  
→ Buy 1 Put Option slightly OTM, 2-3 months out.  
→ If AAPL crashes, your put gains value and covers your loss.

## Other Hedging Methods

- **Straddle**: Buy a Call and Put at the same strike → You profit from a big move either way.
- **Strangle**: Buy a Call and Put at different strikes → Cheaper but needs a bigger move.
- **Pairs Trading**: Long one stock, short a highly correlated stock.
- **Currency Hedging**: In Forex, open a reverse position if there’s a risky event.

## Key Things to Understand

- Hedging is **insurance**. Insurance has a **cost**. That cost eats into profits.
- Over-hedging = you end up killing your own profitability.
- Good hedging only protects **critical positions** or **big exposures**.
- Sometimes the best hedge is **sizing smaller** from the beginning.
- I only Hedge if and when i might be trading news and there are going to be whiplashes, more specifically if i know the asset is something like stocks, generally it tends to go up in the long run, if the expected news is going to be bearish then i take a hedged position so both moves will give me returns. if the expected news is positive i do not hedge, cause price might never come down for you to profit from your sell position.
## Reminder

If you are forced to hedge all the time, maybe you are overleveraged or trading wrong.  
True professional hedging is **planned**, not **panicked**.
