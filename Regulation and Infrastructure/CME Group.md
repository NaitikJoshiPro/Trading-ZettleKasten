A **futures contract** is a standardized agreement to buy or sell an asset at a future date for a specified price. CME Group is a leader in futures contracts and offers contracts for various financial instruments, commodities, and indices.

### 3.1 **How Futures Work**
When a trader buys a futures contract, they agree to take delivery of the underlying asset (e.g., crude oil, gold) at a future date unless they close their position before expiration. Conversely, sellers agree to deliver the asset at the specified expiration date.

CME Group offers a broad range of futures contracts, including:
- **Commodity Futures**: Crude oil, gold, and agricultural products like corn and soybeans.
- **Financial Futures**: U.S. Treasury bonds, interest rates, and stock market indices like the S&P 500.

## 4. **Options on Futures**

In addition to futures, CME Group offers **options on futures** contracts. These are derivative contracts that give the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell a futures contract at a predetermined price before the option's expiration date.

- **Example**: A trader may buy a call option on a crude oil futures contract, giving them the right to buy crude oil at a certain price before the option expires. If the price of oil rises, the trader can profit by exercising the option.
